* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a modified version of the master. you would use one to work on a different component of the master. A large project may have many branches that could have lots of different software developers all working on.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit it creating a savepoint to a file or code. 
A good commit message is very specific on what changes were made such as "Added sunglasses to the octopus"
